\section{Introduction}

This document describes the work carried out within the course of \textbf{Computer Architecture and Operating Systems}, with the aim of developing skills in the emulation of heterogeneous hardware architectures using \textbf{QEMU}, porting the \textbf{FreeRTOS} operating system, and collaboratively managing code through \textbf{Git}.

\noindent The project is divided into three main phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Emulation of a board in QEMU}: Implementation of support for the \textbf{NXP S32K3X8EVB} board, including CPU, memory mapping, and UART and CAN drivers.
    \item \textbf{Porting of FreeRTOS}: Verification of the correct functioning of the operating system in the emulated environment.
    \item \textbf{Development of a test application}: Implementation of a multitasking application to validate the emulation.
\end{itemize}

Everything has been implemented and developed within a GitLab repository, a process that required careful collaboration and constant team coordination.

The objective of this document is to provide a detailed technical description of the implementation process, illustrating the design choices adopted, the challenges encountered, and the solutions implemented.

Furthermore, the \textbf{README} files in GitLab provide instructions for compilation, execution, and testing of the emulated environment.
